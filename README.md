# Syntax References :book:

Welcome to my [**syntax_references**](https://github.com/rendiandriyanto/syntax_references) repository!

Although this repository is openly accessible, it is basically reserved for my use only. This repository serves as a *brainstorming* tool and a means for me to recognize and reward myself when I reach certain programming *milestones*.

The main purpose of this repository is to document the various programming syntaxes that I have learned, with each file containing explanations in ***Bahasa Indonesia***[^1] to help me understand the concepts more quickly and easily.

I hope this repository provides useful information about my experience in learning programming and the skills I have developed :eyes:
